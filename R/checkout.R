#' Checkout policies in UK supermarkets
#'
#' Panel data on checkout policy and sales of unhealthy snacks at six UK
#' supermarkets. Six supermarkets are measured every four weeks, with number
#' of units of unhealthy snacks sold recorded at each time point.  Four of
#' these supermarkets institute a checkout policy after the first 14 four-week
#' periods.  Note that these data have been modified for pedagogical purposes:
#' the original dataset contains six stores, all of which instituted checkout
#' policies, but in this version two of the stores have been relabeled as pure
#' controls and their post-time-of-treatment sales numbers have been altered.
